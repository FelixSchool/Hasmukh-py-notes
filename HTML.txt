Anatomy of HTML element:
    The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p for paragraph), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph text.
    The content: This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the paragraph text.
    The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.

Nesting elements:
    Elements can be placed within other elements. This is called nesting
    eg: <p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p>

Block / inline elements:
    A block-level element appears on a new line following the content that precedes it. Any content that follows a block-level element also appears on a new line

    nline elements are contained within block-level elements, and surround only small parts of the documentâ€™s content (not entire paragraphs or groupings of content). An inline element will not cause a new line to appear in the document. It is typically used with text, for example an <a> element creates a hyperlink, and elements such as <em> or <strong> create emphasis.

Empty elements:
    Not all elements follow the pattern of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Some elements consist of a single tag, which is typically used to insert/embed something in the document. 

Attributes:
    Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content. In this example, the class attribute is an identifying name used to target the element with style information.
    
Active learning: Adding attributes to an element:
    Another example of an element is <a>. This stands for anchor. An anchor can make the text it encloses into a hyperlink.
    href: This attribute's value specifies the web address for the link. For example: href="https://www.mozilla.org/".
    title: The title attribute specifies extra information about the link, such as a description of the page that is being linked to. For example, title="The Mozilla homepage". This appears as a tooltip when a cursor hovers over the element.
    target: The target attribute specifies the browsing context used to display the link. For example, target="_blank" will display the link in a new tab. If you want to display the linked content in the current tab, just omit this attribute.

Boolean attributes:

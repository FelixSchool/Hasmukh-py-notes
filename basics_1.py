Data type:
1. String: string data type is used for storing alpabets
2. Numeric: data type for numbers.
  int - used for stroing whole numbers
  float - used for numbers where decimals are there.
  complex - used for storing complex number (a+bj)
3. Sequence: used for data where grouping is req.
  List - used where list of item is needed to stored. it is changable
  tuple - used like list but the items are unchangable 
  set - used like list but only unique values are stored.
4. Boolean: used for True (1) and False (0)
5. Binary: uses 0 and 1 to define any number 
  Oct - has a range of 0-7
  Hex - has a range of 16 i.e. 0-7 & a-f
 Bytes: it is a data type which helps to convert data type to binary
        only contain value of range of 0-255
        stores in hexadecimal format
 Bytearray: changable 
 Memoryview: it is useful for looking into the data of object (for eg bytearray)
 it can also help to change the values of the object

Fetching data type:
  we can get to know the type of data by - =type(object)
  
Chnaging data type: 
  two types of conversions:
    1. implicit: done by python automatically , python coverts the result data type to higher one from the involved objects
    2. Explicit: done by user, can be done by useing syntax:<req_datatype>(expression)

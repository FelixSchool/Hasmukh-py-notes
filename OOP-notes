Python Objects and Classes:

- Defining a Class in Python:
Like function definitions begin with the def keyword in Python, class definitions begin with a class keyword.

Here is a simple class definition.

class MyNewClass:
    '''This is a docstring. I have created a new class'''
    pass
    
There are also special attributes in it that begins with double underscores __. 

Creating an Object in Python:
we can use class function to make object, for eg: object = class()

Constructors in Python:
Class functions that begin with double underscore __ are called special functions as they have special meaning.
Of one particular interest is the __init__() function. This special function gets called whenever a new object of that class is instantiated.

Deleting Attributes and Objects:
Any attribute of an object can be deleted anytime, using the del statement.
